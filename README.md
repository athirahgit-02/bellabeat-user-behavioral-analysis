# bellabeat-case-study
Data analysis case study on FitBit fitness tracker data using SQL, Python, and Tableu

## 1. Ask phase

### Business Task
To gain insight into how customers are using smart devices to help guide Bellabeat's marketing strategy

### Stakeholder
Urška Sršen: Co-founder & Chief Creative Officer  
Sando Mur: Co-founder & Executive Team Member  
Marketing Analytics Team: Primary user of data to get marketing insight

### SMART Question
What is the average daily step count and hour of sleep for smart device user within 31 day period and how Bellabeat can use this data to promote better lifestyle habit through Bellabeat app?

## 2. Prepare phase

### Data source: 'Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data' are used, which was available on Kaggle by Mobius. This dataset contain personal fitness tracker data from thirty fitbit users.

### ROCCC Analysis  
Reliable: Low due to small sample size (30 users)  
Original: Low as data is obtained from third party survey (Amazon Mechanical Turk)  
Comprehensive: Medium due to lack demographic data (age/gender)  
Current: Low. Data is from 2016 and may be unrelevant for present times  
Cited: High as data is well-documented in Kaggle and is publicly available (public domain CC0)

### Data Organization  
The data is stored in 18 CSV files. For this analysis, I will be focusing on:
1. dailySteps_merged
2. sleepDay_merged

## 3. Process phase  

### Tools  
SQL (BigQuery): Data cleaning, transformation and merging  
Excel: Initial data upload and schema verification  

### Data cleaning & transformation  
To prepare the data for further analysis, I performed the following steps:  
1. Format Standardization: Converted date columns from String to Date for time-based data
2. Duplicate removal: Identified 3 suplicate entries in `sleepDay` table and removed them
3. Null removal: Removed 0 entry in `dailySteps` table
4. Data Merging: Joined `cleaned_step` and `cleaned_sleep` tables on `Id` and `Date` to create dataset for further correlation analysis

### Troubleshooting  
Challenge: Encountered a parsing error when uploading sleepDay_merged.csv due to non-ISO date formatting (MM/DD/YYYY AM/PM)  
Resolution: Manually defined the schema as STRING during upload to bypass auto-detection errors, followed by PARSE_TIMESTAMP in SQL to standardize the data for analysis.

### Documentation of Changes
All SQL scripts used for cleaning process can be found in `/scripts` folder of this repository
